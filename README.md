The code of the paper "Zhaoyin Shi, et al. Parameter-Free Robust Ensemble Framework of Fuzzy Clustering.IEEE TFS, DOI: 10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3277692, May. 2023". 
To use it, please cite the paper. 
The Inputs are BaseClusterings U in the paper. In the Demo, they are the same with the paper and the readers can change the Input.
The Outputs: F is the ensemble membership matrix; Result is the clustering metrics, from top to bottom: PFREFF, FCM(Average), FCM(Std), from left to right: ACC, NMI, Purity. gnd is the ground truth. J is the
value of the objective function. Tsum is the running time.
